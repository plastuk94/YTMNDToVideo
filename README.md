# YTMNDToVideo
Converts YTMNDs to basic videos (MP4)

Thanks to https://github.com/philleif/ytmnd-to-tiktok for showing how it can be done.

# How to Use
Enter the entire URL, e.g. "https://epicgeordi.ytmnd.com/" and press Enter.

The output video should be in "output.mp4" in same directory.

# Unimplemented features
The text on the YTMND is currently not included in the video.

It should be possible to add the text overlay in ffmpeg, but I haven't bothered yet.
